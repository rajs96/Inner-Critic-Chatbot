In order to align our chat agent, we need to have some strategy to have it learn the inputs and appropriate responses. There are generally two phases - offline learning and online learning. In this case, offline learning involves supervised training data. Online learning will involve adapting to continual feedback - the way this has traditionally been done as of late is through reinforcement learning. This document will outline how the initial training data was curated and generated, along with the associated challenges.
