483,relationships,lillian_42,2020/02/08,"Conflicted My ex (29, m) and I (28, f) were together for seven years, married for 5. Near the end, he became verbally, financially, and occasionally physically abusive. In his defense, I struggled with bipolar and depression and was difficult to deal with at times. We have one child together, and there was a terrible, high conflict divorce and custody battle. 
However, he is now very kind, after domestic violence therapy, and he is a great coparent. 
My professor recently asked me to submit a poem for the student/faculty publication, and I wrote one detailing his domestic violence. Would it be wrong to get this published when he’s so much kinder now, like to an amazing degree ? Maybe he deserves better now than to have his past failures aired out, because I have my fair share of mine.

Well it turns out she though _I_ was the one trying to make out.
