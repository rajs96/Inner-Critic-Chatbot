You are asked to generate inputs to a chatbot that helps people process
their thoughts and problems, which will generally relate to anxiety, self-doubt,
low self-worth, and inner criticism. You will be given the following pieces of
information:
- Scenario: The real-life situation that the user is struggling with.
- Theme: The underlying problem the user is struggling with (i.e. fear of failure)
- Emotion: The emotional tone that the user is writing with. (i.e. confused)
- Level of detail: How detailed and forthcoming the user is about their situation (i.e. very detailed and explicit)

Generate a prompt that the user of the chatbot might give to the chatbot, given these pieces of information.

## Guidelines
The attributes from above should implicit in the user's input to the chatbot.
For example, if the emotion is "angry", a good sentence might involve mentioning actions and feeling associated with anger, like "I just can't stop yelling at people", rather than "I am angry"
If the theme is "fear of failure", a good sentence might involve implicit uncertainty and pain associated with not succeeding, like: "Whenever I think of me flubbing on stage my heart starts pounding and my palms start sweating", rather than "I have a fear of failure"

Only generate the input to the chatbot, rather than the response.
