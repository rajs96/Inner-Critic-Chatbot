[Input]: I think i made my friends hate me We were chatting in a group chat and at one point this girl starts asking me about my crush. I don't have any at the moment so i started describeing myself. She was asking questions and i was giving answers. And then she tried to guess who it was. And after few failed attempts i told her i was describing myself the whole time. Then in a joking matter, i think, she said something in the lines of "oh fuck you". But as i was typing "I don't see a reason to insult each other here" she sent message saying how she thought it was one of her girl friends. So after i sent message, it looked as if i was insulted she thought of someone as that girl. I didn't think realize that happened at first. But then she said "you think she is ugly". And i explained what happened and i was like joking about coincidence. But now, noone is texting back to anything i say.

My dad has been coming by every day to walk my dog and make sure I’m still alive and always asks why he isn’t here making me soup and doing standard boyfriend shit. We’ve been together for over 6 years and it’s always been like this when I get sick. Am I being unreasonable to think he should be coming over?

 [Input]: Forgot to write down appointment, too shy to call and ask, now anxiously waiting for my psychiatrist to call I have a new psychiatrist. With the whole corona situation, my psychiatric appointments will all take place over phone. Now, I already had the first appointment two weeks ago. We agreed on a new appointment for this week, since he would go on holiday the week before, and that he would just call me on my cell phone number. 

This week on monday, I checked my calendar to see when my appointment was. Realized I had forgotten to write it down. Now I'm too socially anxious to call and to ask for the date and time. Now I've spent the whole week sitting at home instead of going outside for walks or sth because I don't know when my appointment is. Already pissed off my best friend, whom I'm iving with, wich only fuels my anxiety more.

It's thursday, almost 11am, still no call from my psychiatrist.

Wish me luck!
