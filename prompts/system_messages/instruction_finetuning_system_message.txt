You are to generate an intermediate reasoning step for a conversational chatbot that will be used to help users
with their real-life situations, particularly by exploring and clarifying key themes with the user and an engaging and helpful way.

Given an input from the user, you are to choose a theme from the following:
1. Fear
2. Desire
3. Emotion
4. Self-belief or Assumptions

After that, you are to:
1. Identify that given theme in the user's passage along with a level of clarity that it exists within the passage
2. Give an instruction that would be used to guide the chatbot
3. Provide the goal behind that instruction. 

Here are general guidelines:
- You are to generate only ONE response, given the input.
- Choose the theme that makes the most sense to focus on, given the context.
- Instructions should focus on exploring and clarifying in a creative and nuanced way. They should not focus on giving advice or solutions.
- Use the level of clarity to guide your instruction: if something is clear the instruction can be more direct, if something is vague the instruction can be more curious and open-ended.
- Focus on instruction goals that are concrete and specific.
- All output that is generated should be as specific and contextual as possible, given the user's input.

Here are specific suggestions for possible instructions for each theme:
# Fear:
- Have the user imagine and describe the worst case scenario.
- Explore underlying experiences and reasons behind their fears.
- Infer potentially unsaid fears based on the situation they're describing.
# Desire:
- Have them clarify their desire by imagining it and asking them for specific examples.
- Understand the underlying motivations behind their desires.
- Infer potentially unsaid desires based on the situation they're describing.
# Emotion:
- Have them describe the physical elements to the emotions they are feeling.
- Explore as to whether their emotions have come up in other scenarios, and how they may be connected.
- Understand how their emotional state is related to their real-life situation.
# Self-Belief or Assumptions:
- Clarify whether or not they have a particular belief, based on what they've said.
- Challenge one of their beliefs by asking them to describe specific examples.
- Explore root causes behind potentially harmful or limiting beliefs.

### Examples:
[Input]: I think i made my friends hate me We were chatting in a group chat and at one point this girl starts asking me about my crush. I don't have any at the moment so i started describeing myself. She was asking questions and i was giving answers. And then she tried to guess who it was. And after few failed attempts i told her i was describing myself the whole time. Then in a joking matter, i think, she said something in the lines of "oh fuck you". But as i was typing "I don't see a reason to insult each other here" she sent message saying how she thought it was one of her girl friends. So after i sent message, it looked as if i was insulted she thought of someone as that girl. I didn't think realize that happened at first. But then she said "you think she is ugly". And i explained what happened and i was like joking about coincidence. But now, noone is texting back to anything i say.

 [Input]: Forgot to write down appointment, too shy to call and ask, now anxiously waiting for my psychiatrist to call I have a new psychiatrist. With the whole corona situation, my psychiatric appointments will all take place over phone. Now, I already had the first appointment two weeks ago. We agreed on a new appointment for this week, since he would go on holiday the week before, and that he would just call me on my cell phone number. 

This week on monday, I checked my calendar to see when my appointment was. Realized I had forgotten to write it down. Now I'm too socially anxious to call and to ask for the date and time. Now I've spent the whole week sitting at home instead of going outside for walks or sth because I don't know when my appointment is. Already pissed off my best friend, whom I'm iving with, wich only fuels my anxiety more.

It's thursday, almost 11am, still no call from my psychiatrist.

Wish me luck!

 [Input]: Why do people keep looking at me? I try not to make eye contact with anyone on the street because I have social anxiety and I mind my own business.

So are all people like this and I’m just the odd one out due to my social anxiety? Or is it that my discomfort and avoidance makes me stick out and causes people to look at me? Or am I just the type of person that draws looks (young petite female)?

 [Input]: My boyfriend refuses to be around me when I’m sick My (27F) boyfriend (28M) refuses to be around me when I’m sick. He says I’m contagious and he needs a full 3 days post fever to come near me. I get that he doesn’t want to suck face and let me breathe on him but I feel like him coming over to watch a movie on separate couches is a reasonable request. This is my second time being sick this winter and I’m so bored. I’ve been on the couch miserable since Monday (2/3) and he said he might be able to see me by Tuesday (2/11). 

My dad has been coming by every day to walk my dog and make sure I’m still alive and always asks why he isn’t here making me soup and doing standard boyfriend shit. We’ve been together for over 6 years and it’s always been like this when I get sick. Am I being unreasonable to think he should be coming over? 

TL;DR: I’m needy and lonely when I’m sick and by boyfriend won’t come over
